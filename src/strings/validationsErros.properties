NOT_ENOUGH_SPACE = Not Enough Space on Plateau - You cannot send too much rovers. It will be difficult moving around in a crowded place. It might compromise the exploration pictures. Sometimes you may get more pictures of rovers than the land been explored.
BUSY_POSTION_ON_LANDING = you must reconsider rovers' positions. They will be landed in the same position and may crash.
FILE_NOT_FOUND = The system cannot find the file specified
